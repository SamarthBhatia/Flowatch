echo "7. QUICK FIX PROCEDURE"
echo "====================="
echo ""
echo "If behavior monitoring isn't working, try this:"

echo "Step 1: Stop current firewall"
echo "  sudo pkill -f firewall"
echo ""
echo "Step 2: Start firewall with explicit config"
echo "  sudo ../build/firewall start"
echo ""
echo "Step 3: In firewall interactive mode, run:"
echo "  config enable_behavior_monitoring true"
echo "  config behavior_learning_period 1"
echo "  config log_level debug"
echo "  status"
echo ""
echo "Step 4: Generate traffic and monitor:"
echo "  curl http://httpbin.org/ip"
echo "  (should see logs about packet processing)"
echo ""
echo "Step 5: Wait 2 minutes then check:"
echo "  ls -la ~/.config/firewall/"
echo "  cat ~/.config/firewall/behavior_profiles.json"
echo ""

echo "8. ALTERNATIVE TESTING METHOD"
echo "============================="
echo ""
echo "If behavior profiles still don't appear, test without profiles:"
echo ""
echo "A. Test basic anomaly detection:"
echo "   ./scripts/anomaly_unusual_ports.sh"
echo "   (should see 'Blocked connection' or 'Rule evaluation' in logs)"
echo ""
echo "B. Test rule-based detection:"
echo "   ../build/firewall add-rule curl block httpbin.org 80"
echo "   curl http://httpbin.org/ip"
echo "   (should be blocked and logged)"
echo ""
echo "C. Check traffic statistics:"
echo "   ../build/firewall status"
echo "   (should show packet counts and connection stats)"
echo ""

echo "üéØ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR"
echo "==================="
echo ""
echo "When working correctly, you should see:"
echo "‚úÖ Firewall responds to commands"
echo "‚úÖ Config directory and files exist"
echo "‚úÖ Packet processing logs appear"
echo "‚úÖ behavior_profiles.json gets created"
echo "‚úÖ Profiles show applications and connections"
echo "‚úÖ profileComplete becomes true after learning period"
echo ""
echo "If you don't see these, the issue is likely:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Firewall not running with proper permissions (need sudo)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Wrong network interface selected"
echo "‚Ä¢ Behavior monitoring disabled in code"
echo "‚Ä¢ Insufficient time for profile creation"
echo ""

echo "Run this troubleshooting script again after making changes!"
